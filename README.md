Flutter E-commerce Application
üìñ Overview
This is a modern, cross-platform e-commerce mobile application built using Flutter and Dart. The project is designed with a focus on clean architecture, scalability, and maintainability. It Developed with the BLoC and Cubit patterns for robust state management, features a library of custom widgets for a consistent and beautiful UI, and uses a named routing strategy for clear and decoupled navigation.
The application provides a seamless shopping experience, allowing users to browse products, manage their cart, and proceed with orders on both Android and iOS devices.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The application follows the BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture, which separates the presentation layer from the business logic, making the app easier to test, maintain, and scale.
